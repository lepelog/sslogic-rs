- progress locations are purely determined by settings and progress dungeons
- items can either be progress or nonprogress
 - all progress items are always in progress locations
 - an item can also be marked as "relevant", which means it's nonprogress but only appears in progress locations
- we need to determine ER (leave out for now, keep vanilla)
- we need to separate the progress items from the nonprogress items
 - every item that doesn't have the ability to unlock a location
